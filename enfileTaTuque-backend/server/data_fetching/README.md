1. Create an environment and install the dependencies in requirements.txt
2. Create a .env file and add this line in it: `AZURE_STORAGE_CONNECTION_STRING = "<connection_string>"`. You can find the <connection_string> for the storage account in the Access Keys tab under Security + Networking in the Azure portal.
